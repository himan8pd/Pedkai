# Pedkai Final Production Sign-Off (v2)
**Date:** February 11, 2026
**Status:** ✅ AUTHORIZED FOR DEPLOYMENT

## Executive Summary
Following the v8 Strategic Audit rejection, a high-intensity "Production Hardening" sprint has successfully mitigated all High and Medium severity risks. The Pedkai system is now technically robust, architecturally secure, and governed by a multi-session risk control framework.

## Hardening Verification

| Finding | Risk Mitigation | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **H-8: Security** | Absolute path prioritization + SHA256 Checksum Verification. | **HARDENED** |
| **H-9: Logic** | Parent-node entity inference for amorphous incident detection. | **RESOLVED** |
| **M-7: Governance** | Cumulative Revenue Protection ($50k global limit) implemented. | **RESOLVED** |
| **M-8: Alignment** | Benchmarks synchronized with PGVector production profile. | **RESOLVED** |

## Conclusion
The "Death by a Thousand Cuts" scenario is now governed by the Policy Engine, and the "Telco Constitution" is protected against runtime tampering. All integration tests confirm that Pedkai correctly balances autonomous speed with financial safety.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to Production Rollout (Stage 1).
