# Pedkai Strategic Audit Report: Iteration 2 Rework (v6)

**Auditor**: Telecom Business Strategist  
**Status**: 🟡 **CONDITIONALLY APPROVED** (Score: 7.5/10)  
**Date**: 11 February 2026

## ✅ Progress Assessment
The vendor has made significant strides in moving the system from "Demo Theatre" to "Real Logic." The implementation of **Recursive CTEs** for graph traversal and **Live SQL Queries** for reinforcement learning feedback is a professional-grade improvement.

The system is now functionally stable and the critical regressions (Main.py startup) have been resolved.

## 🚩 Residual Risks & Strategic Findings

### [H-6] Operational Parameter Hardcoding (Governance Risk)
**Finding**: Critical business thresholds are still "buried" in Python service code rather than the Policy Engine.
- [rl_evaluator.py](file:///Users/himanshu/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-himanshu@htadvisers.co.uk/My%20Drive/AI%20Learning/AntiGravity/Pedkai/scripts/verify_rl_evaluator.py): Hardcoded 10% improvement threshold for rewards.
- [cx_intelligence.py](file:///Users/himanshu/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-himanshu@htadvisers.co.uk/My%20Drive/AI%20Learning/AntiGravity/Pedkai/backend/app/services/cx_intelligence.py): Hardcoded 0.7 churn risk threshold for customer impact.
**Impact**: Business users cannot adjust the "sensitivity" of the AI without code changes.
**Feedback**: Move these into [global_policies.yaml](file:///Users/himanshu/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-himanshu@htadvisers.co.uk/My%20Drive/AI%20Learning/AntiGravity/Pedkai/backend/app/policies/global_policies.yaml) under a `parameters` block.

### [H-7] Heuristic Metric Mapping (Fragility Risk)
**Finding**: The RL Evaluator uses string searches (`if "latency" in description`) to decide which KPI to check.
**Impact**: In production, alarm titles are noisy. A title like "Optimization Event: Link Degradation" might default to `throughput` when it should have checked `latency` or `retransmissions`.
**Feedback**: Integrate with the RCA Engine results which already categorize the event, or use a lookup table based on Alarm IDs.

### [M-5] Topology Ingestion Gap (Architectural Debt)
**Finding**: While the Recursive CTE works, there is no evidence of a live ingestion pipeline (CIM/Inventory sync) to populate the `topology_relationships` table.
**Impact**: The graph will become stale as the network evolves.
**Feedback**: Implement a basic TMF633 (Service Inventory) listener or a periodic CIM ingestor.

### [M-6] Cost Control vs. Visibility Tradeoff
**Finding**: The LLM sampling rate (Finding #36) prevents redundant calls but might miss high-value incidents.
**Impact**: A $10,000 revenue-at-risk event might be "sampled out" and never generate a SITREP.
**Feedback**: Policy-weighted sampling—ensure high-priority or high-revenue events are *never* sampled out.

## 📜 Final Scorecard

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Functional Integrity** | 8/10 | CTE and SQL logic are robust. |
| **Governance & Policy** | 5/10 | Thresholds are still code-locked. |
| **Technical Debt** | 8/10 | `utcnow` removal complete; imports fixed. |
| **System Resilience** | 9/10 | BSS integration is real and joins correctly. |

**Final Recommendation**: Proceed to Execution of Iteration 3 to externalize parameters, then sign off for Phase 16.
