# Mock Netconf Certificates (P5.4)

This directory contains mock TLS certs used by the Netconf PoC adapter for local testing. These files are intentionally placeholders and should be replaced by real certs in secure environments.

- ca.pem (optional)
- server.pem (optional)
- server.key (optional)

No real certificates are included in this repo. Generate using OpenSSL for local testing when needed.
