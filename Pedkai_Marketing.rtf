\f0  **Pedkai: The AI-Native Brain for Tomorrow's Telcos**\
\
**Transform Chaos into Clarity. Slash MTTR by 80%. Protect Revenue at Every Signal.**\
\
In a world where networks hum at 500k+ events/second, legacy systems choke. Pedkai doesn't just monitor\'d1it **thinks, decides, and acts** like your most seasoned NOC engineer, but 24/7, at hyperscale. Built for Vodafone, Jio, and Verizon-scale operators, Pedkai is the **AI Control Plane** that overlays your BSS/OSS stack, turning raw telemetry into revenue-saving intelligence.\

\f0  **Why Pedkai? The Telco Revolution You Can't Afford to Miss**\
\
| **The Old Way** | **The Pedkai Way** |\
|-----------------|--------------------|\
| **Reactive firefighting**: Hours lost chasing alarms in silos. | **Proactive mastery**: AI detects anomalies in seconds, roots causes in minutes, resolves in a flash. |\
| **Siloed data**: Metrics, tickets, and billing worlds apart. | **Unified fabric**: Streams Kafka telemetry into a "Decision Memory" that learns *why* fixes work. |\
| **Blind automation**: Risks revenue with one-size-fits-all rules. | **Policy-smart actuation**: YAML "Telco Constitution" enforces SLAs, prioritizes gold customers, and calculates "Revenue at Risk" live. |\
| **Scalability nightmares**: Legacy OSS buckles under 5G floods. | **Enterprise ironclad**: Multi-tenant SaaS on GCP/AWS, TMF-compliant, vendor-agnostic (Ericsson XML? Nokia JSON? No sweat). |\
\
**Proven ROI**: In simulated pilots, Pedkai cut **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)** from 4 hours to **12 minutes**\'d1that's **95% faster recovery**, zero customer churn from silent failures.\

\f0  **Core Superpowers: Intelligence That Evolves**\
\
### **1. ANOps Wedge: Autonomous Network Ops on Steroids**\
- **Anomaly Detection**: Z-Score magic spots 80% throughput drops, 15% VoLTE call drops, or "sleeping cells" (zero users, zero alarms).\
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Graph traversal uncovers upstream gremlins\'d1like IMS core signaling jamming emergency 999/911 dial-outs.\
- **Expanded Scenarios**: Handles congestion offloads, SMS delivery spikes, and landline compliance\'d1**all with causal AI (Granger-tested)** to prove "Load *caused* Latency."\
\
### **2. Decision Memory: Your Network's "Black Box" of Wisdom**\
- Not just logs\'d1**traces of *why***: Captures tradeoffs, constraints (e.g., "No maintenance window? Failover now!"), and outcomes.\
- **Semantic Search**: pgvector + Gemini embeddings match "similar crises" at 0.9 precision, re-ranking by operator upvotes (RLHF-powered).\
- **Learn & Adapt**: From 10+ public datasets (5G faults, churn signals, support tickets) to your proprietary streams\'d1Pedkai gets smarter with every incident.\
\
### **3. Revenue Shield: BSS Meets AI**\
- **Live Financial Context**: Links alarms to billing accounts\'d1spot a cell outage? Instantly calculate **$X at risk** for enterprise SLAs.\
- **Proactive Care**: High-churn customers (score >0.7)? Auto-trigger notifications before complaints hit.\
- **Capacity Oracle**: Greedy ROI engine densifies sites under 85% PRB load, respecting budgets.\
\
### **4. Human + AI Symphony**\
- **NOC Dashboard**: Next.js beauty with live SITREPs\'d1"AI says: Drain IMS traffic. Last time? 10-min fix, zero impact."\
- **Human Loop**: Upvote/downvote decisions, acknowledge alarms via TMF642\'d1your team trains the AI.\
- **Safety First**: Circuit breakers, OTel tracing, and declarative policies lock out risky moves.\

\f0  **Built for the Big Leagues: Tech That Scales Fearlessly**\
\
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI\'d1blazing APIs for TMF642/628 compliance.\
- **Data Fortress**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB (hot/warm/cold tiers) + Kafka streams\'d1handles 500k EPS without breaking a sweat.\
- **AI Edge**: Gemini for explainable reasoning + PyTorch for causal patterns.\
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes-ready, multi-tenant SaaS\'d1GCP/AWS, secrets-safe, TLS-everywhere.\
\
**Phased to Perfection**: From MVP fabric (Phase 1) to full AI Control Plane (Phase 15)\'d1deploy in 12-16 weeks, iterate forever.\
