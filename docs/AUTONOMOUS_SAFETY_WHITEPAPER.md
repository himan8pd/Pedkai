## 1. Executive Summary

Pedkai is an AI-assisted network operations platform designed for UK telecommunications operators. This whitepaper defines the safety architecture, human oversight mechanisms, and risk mitigation controls that govern all automated and autonomous operations within the platform.

**Key Safety Principle**: Pedkai operates at AI Maturity Level 2 (Supervised/Advisory). All AI-generated recommendations require human approval before execution. Autonomous execution (Level 3) is gated behind a comprehensive safety framework described herein.

## 2. Safety Architecture

### 2.1 Defence-in-Depth Gateway Pipeline

Every autonomous action traverses a four-gate safety pipeline:

| Gate | Name | Function | Failure Mode |
|------|------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Blast Radius** | Rejects actions affecting >10 entities | Hard block, no override |
| 2 | **Policy Engine** | Evaluates action against operator-defined rules | Configurable deny/allow |
| 3 | **Confirmation Window** | Time-bounded human override window | Auto-proceed after timeout |
| 4 | **Post-Execution Validation** | KPI polling for 5 minutes post-action | Auto-rollback on >10% degradation |

### 2.2 Kill-Switch

An emergency kill-switch endpoint (`POST /api/v1/autonomous/kill-switch`) marks the last N actions as `rolled_back`, providing immediate operator control. This endpoint is protected by authentication and audit-logged.

### 2.3 AI Maturity Ladder

| Level | Mode | Behaviour | Current Status |
|-------|------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Assisted (Shadow) | AI observes, no recommendations shown | Supported |
| 2 | **Supervised (Advisory)** | AI recommends, human decides | **Active** |
| 3 | Autonomous | AI executes with safety gates | Gated, requires formal sign-off |

The maturity level is controlled by `ai_maturity_level` in configuration and cannot be escalated without an explicit config change and deployment.

## 3. Data Handling and Privacy

- All customer data is tenant-isolated via `tenant_id` enforcement at the database query level
- PII is scrubbed from AI prompts before transmission to external LLM providers (`pii_scrubber.py`)
- Sovereignty controls prevent data egress from the Pedkai enclave for sovereign tenants
- Revenue figures carry `is_estimate` flags to prevent false precision in financial reporting

## 4. AI Content Watermarking

All AI-generated content carries:
- `ai_generated: true` boolean flag
- `ai_watermark` string: *"This content was generated by Pedkai AI (Gemini). It is advisory only and requires human review before action."*
- `ai_model_version` identifying the model used

## 5. Confidence Scoring

AI confidence scores are derived from Decision Memory similarity (cosine distance via pgvector), not fabricated. When no similar historical decisions exist, the system defaults to a conservative 0.5 confidence, which triggers additional human review gates.

## 6. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| AI recommends unsafe action | Medium | Critical | Policy engine + blast radius gate |
| Autonomous action degrades KPIs | Low | High | Post-execution validation + auto-rollback |
| Cross-tenant data leakage | Very Low | Critical | Mandatory tenant_id isolation on all queries |
| Revenue overstatement | Medium | High | `is_estimate` flag on all BSS-derived figures |
| LLM hallucination in SITREPs | Medium | Medium | Causal template validation + human review |

## 7. Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Automated KPI monitoring and sleeping cell detection
2. **Containment**: Kill-switch + auto-rollback within 5 minutes
3. **Recovery**: State machine tracks all action states for forensic analysis
4. **Reporting**: Full audit trail with `trace_id`, operator feedback, and RL evaluation records

## 8. Regulatory Alignment

- **Ofcom**: Pre-notification submitted for AI-assisted operations (see `OFCOM_PRE_NOTIFICATION.md`)
- **ICO/GDPR**: Data Protection Impact Assessment completed (see `ICO_DPIA.md`)
- **AI Act (EU)**: Pedkai classifies as "limited risk" — transparency obligations met via watermarking
